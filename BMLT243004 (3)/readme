Description
This program demonstrates the use of conditional statements (if, else if, and else) in C++ to output a message based on the value of the variable time.

How It Works
The variable time is set to 22.
The program checks:
If time is less than 10, it prints "Good morning."
If time is less than 20 but not less than 10, it prints "Good day."
If time is 20 or greater, it prints "Good evening."
Since time is 22, the output will be: Good evening.
