Overview
This simple C++ program prints all even numbers from 0 to 10.

How It Works
The program uses a for loop to repeat actions.
The loop starts with i = 0 and increases i by 2 each time.
It stops once i exceeds 10.
Each value of i is printed on a new line.
Code Breakdown
#include<iostream>: Includes input-output functionality for printing.
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2): Loops through numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
cout << i << "\n";: Outputs the current value of i followed by a newline.
