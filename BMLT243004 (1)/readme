About the Code
This program is a basic C++ script that prints the message "Hello World!" to the screen. It's a classic example used to introduce programming in C++.

Key Points:
Header File: The #include<iostream> is included to allow input/output operations.
Namespace: The using namespace std; simplifies code by avoiding the need to prefix std:: to standard library components like cout.
Main Function: The main() function is where the program starts executing.
Output: The cout statement displays "Hello World!".
Return 0: Signals that the program ended successfully.
This program is ideal for beginners to understand the basic structure of a C++ program.
